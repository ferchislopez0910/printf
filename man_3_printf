.SH NAME
_printf - format and print data according to a format specifier

.SH SYNOPSIS
printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]... The "holberton.h" header file is needed to use this function.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT.

.SH FORMAT
controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences are:
.SH \      escape the next character
.SH \\     print a backslash
.SH "      start or end of string
.SH \"     print a double quote

.SH %c     print specified character (char)
.SH %s     print specified string of characters
.SH %d     print specified decimal (integer) number (base 10)
.SH %i     print specified integer (base 10)

.SH WIDTH
By saying %5d the number is guaranteed to take up five spaces. Notice that for shorter numbers, the result is padded out with leading spaces. For excessively long numbers there is no padding, and the full number is printed.
.SH ("%5d",0)      ____0
.SH ("%5d",-7)     ___-7
.SH ("%5d",1560133635)     1560133635
